# üó≥Ô∏è Basic Voting System

A **decentralized yes/no voting platform** built on Ethereum, enabling transparent, democratic decision-making. Create proposals, cast votes, and view real-time results with full transparency, security, and immutability ‚Äî all powered by smart contracts.

---

## üìñ Project Description

The Basic Voting System is a trustless, on-chain voting mechanism that allows users to propose topics, vote with a simple **yes/no** input, and transparently see the results. Designed for **fairness**, **security**, and **decentralization**, this system is ideal for DAOs, communities, and organizations seeking blockchain-based decision-making.

## üéØ Project Vision

Our mission is to **democratize governance** by providing a platform where:

- ‚úÖ Every vote is permanently and immutably recorded on the blockchain
- üîç Results are calculated automatically and visibly for all
- üèõÔ∏è No central authority can interfere with voting outcomes
- ü§ù All participants have equal, verifiable voting rights
- üìö Full history of proposals and votes is accessible by anyone

We aim to be the foundation of decentralized governance ‚Äî from grassroots communities to global enterprises.

## üîÑ Transaction Details

The voting system interacts with Ethereum smart contracts. Each major action triggers a blockchain transaction. Here's a breakdown:

| Action              | Function              | Description                                       | Gas Cost (Est.) |
|---------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| üìù Create Proposal   | `createProposal()`     | Deploys a new voting proposal to the blockchain   | ~100,000        |
| üó≥Ô∏è Vote             | `castVote()`          | Records a yes/no vote for a proposal              | ~50,000         |
| ‚èπÔ∏è End Proposal     | `endProposal()`       | Finalizes proposal and freezes voting             | ~40,000         |
| üìä Check Results     | `getProposalResults()` | View tally for a proposal                         | Free (read-only)|

> Note: Users must pay gas fees to interact with these functions. Votes and proposals are permanent once submitted.
